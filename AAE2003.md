    - Artificial feel system.
    - Flight control actuation.
    - Summary.
- **Introduction**:
    - Motions of an aircraft.
    - **Aircraft control** plays a key role in realising a flight.
    - An aircraft should be controlled to:
        - **Maintain stability and safety** of the aircraft.
        - Realise the given flight trajectory.
        - Realise the given flight mission.
    - Diagram shows the **Flight control system** connecting Pilot controls, Sensors, Aircraft dynamics, and Displays, interacting with components like the Primary flight display, Navigation display, AFDS, FCU (Fuel Control Unit), and Flight Management System for control of Attitude, Trajectory, and Mission.
    - Wing warping control in Wright’s Flyer used wires connected to control surfaces and pilot's control.
- **Increasing complexity in flight control**:
    - Challenges in modern aircraft flight control include the higher speed of aircraft with jet propulsion.
- **Pilot controls**:
    - If the pilot needs to rotate, they rotate around the roll axis.
    - If the pilot wishes to speed up/decelerate, they control the engine power.
    - Usually, more than one action is realised simultaneously to achieve the target flight.
- **Flight control surfaces**:
    - The flight control system enables the pilot to complete the motions.
    - Control surfaces are essential components to allow the aircraft to **manoeuvre pitch, roll, and yaw**, and **stabilise the flight**.
    - These are categorised into Primary flight control and Secondary flight control.
    - Flight control actuation enables the ability of the flight control system to attain the performance.
- **Control surfaces: Primary flight control**:
    - Primary flight control in pitch, roll, and yaw is realised by control surfaces.
    - These include:
        - **Aileron control system** (roll): located on the wing.
        - **Elevator control system** (pitch): located on the horizontal tail plane (HTP).
        - **Rudder control system** (yaw): located on the vertical tail plane (VTP).
- **Cockpit control column and rudder pedals**:
    - Pitch control is achieved by moving the control column fore and aft.
        - Pushing forward is pitch down.
        - Pulling back is pitch up.
    - Roll control is achieved by moving the control column from side to side.
    - Yaw control is through rudder pedals.
        - Pushing the left pedal means turning left.
    - Illustrations show the Control yoke (control column) and Pedals.
- **Flight control linkage systems/飛行操縱聯動系統**:
    - These systems transmit the pilot’s manual inputs to the control surfaces.
    - A simple control linkage system might be entirely mechanical.
    - Sophisticated flight control systems may include electrical and hydraulic power.
    - Two main methods connect the pilot’s control to the rest of the system: **Push-pull control rod systems** and **Cable and pulley systems**.
- **Conventional mechanical control system**:
    - An appendix lists common mechanical control system components.
    - Examples show key features of the two types of linkage systems (Cable and pulley, Push-pull control rod).
- **Cable and pulley systems**:
    - Cables are connected from the control in the cockpit to a bell crank, which is then connected to the control surface.
- **Fly-by-wire (FBW)**:
    - A FBW system **replaces the mechanical linkage system** of hydro-mechanical flight control with an **electronic interface** and flight control computers.
    - Pilot inputs via side stick are converted to electronic signals transmitted by wires (hence the term fly-by-wire).
    - Flight control computers determine how to move the actuators at each control surface to provide the expected response.
    - To stabilise the aircraft and alleviate gust loads, flight computers constantly evaluate aircraft motion and input control commands without the pilot's knowledge, which significantly eases pilots’ workload.
    - The **Concorde** was the first aircraft to introduce and utilise Fly-By-Wire technology.
    - For the A320 FBW system, there are a total of **7 flight control computers (FCC)** for flight control computation simultaneously.
        - Two Elevator / Aileron Computers (ELACs) control elevator and aileron actuators.
        - Three Spoiler / Elevator Computers (SECs) control spoilers and provide secondary control to elevator actuators in case of ELACs failure.
        - Two Flight Augmentation Computers (FACs) provide yaw damper function.
    - For the A320 FBW system, electronic control covers Elevators, Ailerons, Roll spoilers, Tail plane trim, Slats, Flaps, Airbrakes, Lift dumpers, while mechanical control covers Rudder and Tail plane trim.
- **Summary**:
    - Principles of flight control: Realise the target flight motion and ensure stability and safety.
    - Direct interaction of the aircraft with air is achieved through control surfaces.
        - Primary control surfaces: elevator, rudder, ailerons.
        - Secondary flight control: HLD (High Lift Devices - although not explicitly defined elsewhere in these excerpts), spoilers, airbrakes, trim tabs.
    - Connection between command and control surface: linkage system.
    - Actuation system: to realise the control actions.
- **Appendix: Mechanical control components**:
    - **Turnbuckles**: Designed to adjust cable length or tension. Used in aircraft construction (e.g., biplanes) and flexible cables in flight control systems. Secured with lockwire or clips to prevent turning due to vibration.
    - **Cable**: Most widely used component in conventional flight control systems. Also used in engine controls, emergency landing gear extension, and other systems. Usually made from galvanized stainless carbon steels.
    - **Pulley brackets**: Often required to safeguard the cable from slipping out of the pulley wheel groove.
    - **Bell cranks**: Used to guide and change the direction of movement. Input and output direction can be designed to any required angle.
    - **Fairlead**: Component designed to guide cable and stop lateral movement. Typically a ring or hook. In aviation, no fairlead may cause a cable direction change of more than three degrees.
    - **Pushrod**.

    - Emergency landing.
- **Introduction**:
    - Despite best efforts, risk of failure or accident that impairs safe operation exists.
    - Such circumstances can lead to damage, injury, and death for crews, passengers, and the public on the ground.
    - **Emergency systems are designed to predict certain failures or accidents**.
    - If the statistical probability of failure/accident is sufficiently high, aircraft incorporate emergency systems to improve survivability.
- **Emergency system integrity**:
    - The integrity level must be high, as it is the final method of survival.
    - The emergency system should be **separated from other aircraft systems** so failures are not propagated to them.
    - It requires:
        - Separated source of power.
        - Alternative methods of operation.
        - Clear emergency warning indications.
- **Warning systems**:
    - Flight and propulsion systems in modern aircraft are automatically controlled.
    - Any detected malfunctions should be sent to the crew for decision.
    - Audible tones are used in the cockpit or on crew headsets.
    - Bells, buzzers, electronic warbles, and tones are in use.
    - A hierarchy of tones is required for unambiguous attention getting when multiple warnings arise.
- **Immediate attention warning sequence**:
    - System warning detected by a sensor or control unit.
    - Signal sent to the central warning panel.
    - Attention getters flash, and audible tones are illuminated.
    - Pilot presses the attention getter to stop flashing and tones.
    - Pilot reads the caption and takes the necessary actions.
- **Flight reference card and multi-function displays**:
    - Flight reference cards are carried to ensure the pilot takes the correct action. The pilot reads the caption rapidly to perform the action.
    - Modern aircraft use **multi-function displays (MFD)** to show warning messages.
    - MFDs can also tell the pilot the action to take.
    - Electronic flight reference can replace flight reference cards.
- **Fire detection and suppression**:
    - Fire can damage the aircraft structure.
    - Most likely location of fire is related to the engine.
    - Detection is necessary in case of accident, apart from prevention efforts.
    - Fire detection systems are often installed in bays where the engine and APU are located to detect temperature.
- **Fire detection technologies**:
    - Thermal switch system.
    - Thermocouple.
    - Optical detection method.
    - Pneumatic thermal fire detection.
    - Thermistor type continuous-loop (Fenwal system, Kidde Continuous-Loop System).
- **Thermal switch system**:
    - Found in many older aircraft.
    - Heat-sensitive units complete electrical circuits at a certain temperature.
    - Has lights energized by aircraft power and thermal switches controlling the lights.
- **Thermocouple type detector**:
    - Measuring junction heated more rapidly than reference junction in a fire, generating a voltage.
    - Voltage above threshold activates a sensitive relay, closing a slave relay to complete the alarming circuit.
- **Optical fire detection systems**:
    - Also called “flame detectors”, detect hydrocarbon flames.
    - Infrared optical fire protection is mainly used in light turboprop aircraft and helicopter engines.
    - Radiation from fire passes through a window and filter to a sensing device, raising its temperature and causing thermoelectric voltages, which are amplified and processed.
- **Pneumatic thermal fire detection**:
    - Based on gas laws (p ∝ T for a given volume).
    - Sensing element is a closed helium-filled tube connected to a responder assembly.
    - As the element heats, gas pressure inside increases until the alarm threshold, closing an internal switch and reporting an alarm to the cockpit.
- **Thermistor type continuous-loop system**:
    - **Fenwal system**: Overheat at any point drops resistance sharply, causing current flow between outer cover and center conductor; Control unit senses current flow and actuates output relay.
    - **Kidde continuous-loop system**: Two wires embedded in an inconel tube with a thermistor core material. One conductor is grounded to the tube, the other connects to the control unit.
- **Emergency power sources**:
    - Redundancy is necessary for continued safe operation in case of failures. Achieved with independent systems.
    - Engine flame out can cause total loss of engine generated power.
    - Emergency power provided by: **Emergency power unit (EPU)**, **Electro-hydraulic pump**, **Ram air turbine (RAT)**.
- **Emergency power unit (EPU)**:
    - Consists of a turbine rotated by energy from fuels like hydrazine/聯氨.
    - Hydrazine stored in a tank, isolated by a shut-off valve opened in emergency.

- **Electro-hydraulic pump**:
    - Provides hydraulic power.
    - Manual or automatic operation initiates a battery to drive a hydraulic pump.
    - Used for a short duration to recover the aircraft and start engines.
    - Used to start hydraulic systems.
    - Example: IDS Tornado emergency power system provides hydraulic power for double engine flame-out/generator failure; Single shot battery activated by explosive device, can drive fuel pump for up to 13 minutes.
- **Ram air turbine (RAT)**:
    - Does not require a source of power.
    - Works due to forward movement of the aircraft.
    - May be called an air driven generator (ADG) on some aircraft.
    - Multi-bladed unit drops from stowed position and provides electric power. Images show RATs on F-105 and F-102 aircraft.
- **Explosion suppression**:
    - **Ullage**: volume above fuel in tanks, mixture of fuel vapour and air, considered an explosion hazard.
    - Possible causes: Lightning strike, External fire, Fire after refuelling, Fire in heated tanks, etc..
    - Electrical components in fuel tanks (probes, sensors, pumps) are risks.
    - Methods to reduce risk: filling ullage space with **reticulated foam** or **nitrogen gas**.
    - Nitrogen gas provided from external source or On Board Inert Gas Generation System (OBIGGS).
- **Emergency oxygen**:
    - For aircraft above 10,000 ft, cabin pressurised for crew/passenger safety/comfort.
    - In case of pressurization failure, oxygen should be provided.
    - Aircrew get oxygen from pressurised bottle via face masks.
    - Passenger masks normally stowed above seats.
    - Aircraft should descend to a height where oxygen concentration is sufficient.
    - If normal supply fails, crew can change over oxygen bottle on ejection seats for a short duration, sufficient for returning to base.
- **Passenger evacuation & crew escape**:
    - Commercial aircraft and military transports must provide evacuation means.
    - Emergency exit doors provided with escape chutes that inflate rapidly.
    - Doors designed with sufficient width, open outwards, identified with illuminated signs.
    - Escape slides: Situated on bottom of half door, carbon fibre pressure cap, lightweight, sizeable; Door opens while armed to deploy slide; Inflation speed improved (1960s: 25 seconds, 2015: 6 seconds).
    - Crew escape: Commercial crew use passenger emergency exit or escape rope; Military crews in combat aircraft use ejection seats.
- **Crash recorder**:
    - Mandatory in commercial aircraft, necessary for military aircraft flying in civilian airspace.
    - Also called accident data recorder, flight recorder, or black box recorder.
    - Used to record flight data and voice.
    - Not a system for reducing injuries, but useful for better understanding of aircraft accidents.
    - Contains a radio and sonar locator to guide rescue crews.

    - Fire resistance: > 30 minutes for 1100℃.
    - Water pressure resistance mentioned.
- **Emergency landing**:
    - Forced landing: unplanned landing out of necessity.
    - Precautionary landing: planned landing due to identified hazard.
    - Ditching: forced landing on water (same as forced landing, but on water).
    - Crash landing: aircraft lands when it receives significant structural damage.
    - Suggested controller actions follow the **ASSIST principle**:
        - **A** (Acknowledge): situation, persons on board, dangerous goods.
        - **S** (Separate): aircraft as necessary, prioritise for landing.
        - **S** (Silence): non-urgent calls, use separate frequency.
        - **I** (Inform): airport emergency services (RFFS), concerned parties.
        - **S** (Support): provide requested information (suitable aerodrome, runway length, etc.).

- **Landing gear parts**:
    - Mentioned include Drag struts, Fairings, Steering mechanisms.
- **Shock absorbing**:
    - During landing, the impact from the ground should be controlled by the landing gear.
    - The shock energy is either moderated and transferred to the airframe or absorbed.
    - Fixed landing gear with flexible struts (steel, aluminium, composite) moderate and transfer impact energy.
    - The **shock strut (Oleo strut)** employs shock absorbers to **convert shock energy into heat**.
- **Issues of deployed landing gear**:
    - Flow separation.
    - Noise emission due to interaction with aerodynamic flows.
- **Landing gear support**:
    - Retractable landing gear must provide **strong attachment when deployed** and **move into the wheel well when stored**.
    - The trunnion is a fixed structural extension of the upper struct cylinder with bearing surfaces for the gear assembly.
    - To enable retraction, a landing gear consists of upper and lower lock links hinged at the centre. Mechanical mechanisms are needed to realise retraction.
- **Landing gear emergency extension**:
    - When the crew turns a crank, it:
        - Isolates the landing gear hydraulics from the overall hydraulic system.
        - Opens hydraulic vent valves and unlocks the doors of the wheel well.
        - Unlocks the main and nose gear that will be extended with gravity.
- **Issues in Jeju Air Flight 2216**:
    - Modern aircraft have sufficient redundancy for landing gear emergencies.
    - In this case, no such preparations were evident.
    - Emergency services arrived only after the crash, suggesting the landing was not planned or communicated as a gear-up emergency.
    - It seems there was a gear collapse.
- **Nose wheel steering system/前輪操縱系統**:
    - Landing gears are used for taxiing on the ground.
    - The nose wheel on most aircraft is steerable from the flight deck.
    - Allows the aircraft to be directed during ground operation.
- **Nose wheel steering: small aircraft**:
    - Steering achieved using a simple system of **mechanical linkages connected to the rudder pedals**.
    - Push-pull tubes connected to pedal horns on the lower strut transfer movement to the strut piston and wheel assembly for rotation.
    - Used for direction/yaw control.
- **Nose wheel steering: large aircraft**:
    - Tricycle configuration often used.
    - A steering till is often used.
    - **Hydraulic power** is often needed.
    - Also used to reduce shimmy related to shock energy.
- **Aircraft braking system/煞車**:
    - All modern aircraft equipped with brakes.
    - Main purposes: **decelerate** aircraft and **hold aircraft stationary**.
    - Differential braking helps steer during taxi.
- **Brakes: locations**:
    - Each main wheel is equipped with a brake unit.
    - Nose wheel may or may not have a brake.
    - Mechanical and hydraulic linkages to the rudder pedals allow the pilot to control brakes.
- **Aircraft brakes principle**:
    - **Convert kinetic energy of motion into heat through friction**.
    - Modern aircraft use **disc brakes**.
    - A disc brake slows rotation by pushing brake pads against a disc with calipers.
    - Size, weight, and landing speed influence disc brake system design.
    - Single, dual, and multiple disc brakes are common; segmented rotor brakes used in large aircraft.
- **Aircraft tires/輪胎**:
    - Necessary to **support aircraft weight** on the ground and provide **traction for braking and stopping**.
    - Also help **absorb landing shock** and **cushion roughness of ground operations**.
    - Unlike car/truck tires, they don't carry load for long periods of continuous operation.
- **Antiskid system**:
    - Functions: **Normal skid control**, **Locked wheel skid control**, **Touchdown protection**, **Fail-safe protection**.
- **Normal skid control**:
    - Performed during slowdown but before coming to a stop.
    - If wheel sliding begins (not full scale), the skid control valve removes some hydraulic pressure to the wheel, letting it rotate faster and stop sliding.
    - Skid detection and control for each wheel is independent.
    - Wheel generator senses speed over 15-20 mph.
- **Fail-safe protection**:
    - Monitors anti-skid system operation.
    - Automatically returns brake system to full manual control if the system fails, with a warning light.
- **Autobrake**:
    - Automatic wheel-based hydraulic brake system for advanced airplanes during take-off/landing.
    - Designed to free pilot for other tasks.
    - Two modes mentioned (details not provided).
- **Aircraft sensors**:
    - **Nose gear compressed sensors**: Located at nose gear strut, signals used to control stall warning and other warning systems.
    - **Weight on wheels (WoW) system**: Switches indicate if aircraft weight is on wheels (airborne or on ground).
    - WoW sensors located at different parts and on the landing gear.
    - Signals from WoW sensors control systems like Nose wheel steering, Trim system, Autopilot, etc..

- **Fluid power**:
    - Uses pressurized fluid to transfer power/energy.
    - **Hydraulic system/液壓系統**: uses **pressurized liquid** (water or oil).
    - Pneumatic system/氣壓系統: uses pressurized gas (air or other gases).
    - **Difference**: gas easier to compress, liquid nearly incompressible. Compressibility defined.
- **Hydraulic power**:
    - Appeared as an efficient way to transfer power from small cockpit movements to high energy demands.
    - Terminology from Greek 'hudro' (water) + 'aulos' (pipe).
- **Application of hydraulics in aircraft**:
    - Widespread use started during WWII with significant advances.
    - By the 1960s, hydraulic systems standardised in commercial/military aircraft, providing reliable performance and safety.
    - Aircraft like Boeing 747 (1968) featured a centralized system.

    - Properties: Small flow rate, Large pressure. Applicable for analysis/design.
    - Hydrostatic pressure at a point in a static liquid depends on depth (p = p₀ + ρgh).
    - Hydraulic leverage principle: Force ratio (F₂/F₁) equals area ratio (S₂/S₁).
    - From mass conservation, displacement (Δρ) varies inversely with area ratio (Δρ₁/Δρ₂ = S₂/S₁). Longer distance (Δρ₁) for high force ratio.
    - Distance not restricted to a direction, can be curved in pipes, saving space.
    - Work input (W₁ = F₁Δρ₁) equals work output (W₂ = F₂Δρ₂). Energy conserved.
- **Hydraulic system design**:
    - Needs to address how pressurized fluid is used, achieved, provided, and controlled, and sustainable operation. Schematic shows Actuator, Pumps, Reservoir, Valves.
    - In practice, design is complex, considering flow rate, pressure, heat loading, criticality, emergency power needs. Fundamental function, performance, safety & reliability are important.

    - Newer synthetic fluids (e.g., MIL-H-83282) reduce flammability but are not fireproof. Standardized tests ensure fire possibility within acceptable level.
- **2. Hydraulic actuation**:
    - Each control surface split into two or more independent parts, each with its own actuator.
    - Common actuator for primary flight control has two pistons in tandem, each connected to a hydraulic system.

    - Stores fluid, assists contamination separation (with filters), helps dissipate heat, some contain magnetic plugs for iron/steel particles. Reservoir shown on aircraft.
    - **Baffle plate** inside separates pump inlet from system to avoid recirculation, allows particles to settle, helps maintain homogeneous temperature.
- **7. Hydraulic pipelines**:
    - Fluids distributed through complex pipelines.
    - Flow experiences pressure drops. Length, diameter, layout determined using pipe flow expressions with corrections.

    - Different parts need different working pressure, requiring various pumping sources.
    - Systems classified (e.g., **Green system, Yellow system, Blue system**). Naming varies.

APU/RAT backup. Used in modern twin-engines (B737, 757, 777, A300, A320, A310). Advantage: generator operates independently, frequency/phase not closely regulated. Disadvantages: unequal loading, loss of gen/APU means complete loss for that bus. Schematic shown.

    - Introduction.
    - Air conditioning (Heating, cooling, humidity control).
    - Pressurization.
    - Anti-g system.
    - Anti-icing and de-icing systems.
    - Anti-misting and de-misting systems.
    - Rain dispersal systems.
    - Summary.
- **The need for a controlled environment**:
    - Commercial aircraft operate primarily in the troposphere and lower stratosphere.
    - High altitude conditions: low pressure, low temperature, low oxygen concentration.
    - Aircraft systems must function reliably in varying environmental conditions.
    - Avionics systems generate heat and should be cooled for performance and safety. Cooling fans used.
    - Other systems (hydraulic, electrical generators, engines, fuel) produce heat, need maintained conditions for efficiency and safety.
    - **Cabin conditioning** is provided to maintain a comfortable environment for passengers and crew.
- **Purposes of cabin environment control**:
    - Maintain acceptable pressure, temperature, humidity, and ventilation.
    - Ensure sufficient oxygen concentration.
    - Avoid fogging/condensation on windows and electrical short circuits.
    - Mitigate smoke and hazardous gases (remove smoke, maintain visibility, remove toxicity, filter fuel vapours).
    - Reduce spread of airborne pathogens (remove bacteria/viruses).
- **Sources of air used for conditioning**:
    - External air (cold, low O₂).
    - Engine bleed air.
    - Recirculation (filtered).
    - Schematic shows external air and engine bleed air processed, mixed with recirculation air, supplied to cabin, then exhausted overboard.
- **Engine bleed air**:
    - **Major source of conditioning air** from high-pressure compressor. Also used for cabin pressurization.
    - Two types of bleed air system: **Open system** (large amount from engines, refrigerate, use in cabin). **Close system** (collect used cabin air, refrigerate, recycle).
- **Close bleed air system**:
    - Less bleed air needed from engine, resulting in higher engine thrust performance.
    - Application still limited. Recycle process requires sealing and pressurization.
    - Extra fans needed for recirculation. Heavier and more expensive than open systems.
- **Air source in aircraft: engines**:
    - Engine provides high-pressure, high-temperature air.
- **Engine bleed air control**:
    - Schematic shown. Once pressure is reduced and modulated by valves, temperature should be regulated before sending to cabin.
- **Cooling of air**:
    - **Vapor cycle refrigeration system (VCM)**: closed system, heat absorbed by evaporation of liquid refrigerant (e.g., Freon).
    - Chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) endanger ozone layer, usage debated.
    - Refrigerant passes through compressor (pressure/temp increased), cooled in condenser (heat rejected to heat sink).
- **Oxygen supply**:
    - Passengers: masks deploy automatically if cabin pressure drops below safe level; chemical generators provide oxygen.
    - Crew: portable oxygen cylinders.
    - **Molecular Sieve Oxygen Concentrator (MSOC)** being developed to produce oxygen from engine bleed air. Used in B787 (optional) and A350XWB.
- **Cabin noise**:
    - Reducing cabin noise necessary for competitiveness. Legislation gradually lowering threshold for people at work.
- **Aircraft noise impact**:
    - Noise requirements regulate influence on surrounding environment.
- **Summary** :
    - Need for controlled environment introduced .
    - Air conditioning (heating, cooling, humidity) .
