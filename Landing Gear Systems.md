# Landing gear layouts
- **Tail Wheel Type**
	- Two main wheels forward of the centre of gravity (C.G.) and a small wheel to support the tail.
        - Advantages: Can employ smaller tires (less drag), cheaper to buy and maintain, easier to handle and maneuver on the ground.
        - Disadvantages: Difficult to see over the nose from the pilot seat, susceptible to ground looping.
        - **Ground looping** is an inherent problem of tail-dragger design, caused by the unstable design (C.G. behind main landing gear) and a destabilizing moment between the C.G. and the gear's centre of friction when swerving.
- **Tricycle landing gear**
	- One or more nose wheels and two or more main wheels after the C.G.. Widely used now.
        - Advantages: Allows more forceful braking at high speeds without nosing over, permits better forward visibility during takeoff, landing, and taxiing, tends to prevent ground looping.
- **Tandem landing gear**
	- More wheels employed in a tandem manner to handle increased weight. Common in large aircraft.
# Landing Gear Components
### Shock Absorbing System
- Controls the impact from the ground during landing.
- Moderates and transfers shock energy to the airframe.
- **Shock absorber/減震器**: Converts shock energy into heat.
    - Fixed landing gear with flexible struts (steel, aluminium, composite) moderate/transfer energy.
    - **Shock strut (Oleo strut)**: A typical design using pneumatic or hydraulic methods (compressed air/nitrogen with hydraulic fluid) to absorb and dissipate load.
        - Upper cylinder (outer): Linked to the airframe, filled with nitrogen with small orifices.
        - Lower cylinder (inner/piston): Linked to the wheel, filled with hydraulic fluids.
        - Pressure from landing forces hydraulic fluid up through orifices, generating heat and dissipating kinematic energy.
    - **Torque links**: Keep the piston and wheels aligned by attaching to the fixed upper cylinder and the piston to prevent rotation.
### Nose Wheel Steering System
- Landing gear is also used for taxiing.
- The nose wheel on most aircraft is steerable from the flight deck.
- Allows the aircraft to be directed during ground operation.
- **Small aircraft**: Simple mechanical linkages connected to rudder pedals. Push-pull tubes transfer pedal movement to the strut piston and wheel assembly for rotation. Provides direction/yaw control.
- **Large aircraft**: Often use tricycle configuration with a steering tiller to steer the nose gear. Hydraulic power is often needed.
    - Control from flight deck via wheel, tillers, or joystick.
    - Control directed to hydraulic fluid via linkages to rotate the lower strut.
    - Accumulator and relief valve keeps fluid under pressure.
    - Follow-up mechanisms (gears, cables, rods) are involved.
- **Shimmy dampers: Necessary to prevent rapid oscillation (shimmy) of the landing gear.
    - Often an oil-filled cylinder with a push-pull rod.
    - Oil flow through holes when the rod moves provides damping.
    - Used to reduce shimmy related to shock energy.
### Braking System
Main purposes: decelerate the aircraft and hold it stationary.
- Differential braking can help steer during taxi.
- Locations: Each main wheel usually has a brake unit. The nose wheel may or may not have a brake.
- Pilot controls brakes via mechanical and hydraulic linkages to the rudder pedals.
- Brake principle: Convert kinetic energy into heat through friction.
- Modern aircraft use disc brakes.
- Disc brake: Slows wheel rotation by pushing brake pads against a brake disc with calipers.
- Design complexity depends on aircraft size, weight, and landing speed.
- Types: Single, dual, multiple disc brakes.
- Segmented rotor brakes are used in large aircraft.
### Tires
- Necessary to support aircraft weight on the ground.
- Provide traction for braking and stopping.
- Help absorb landing shock and cushion ground operations roughness.
- Must absorb high impact loads of landing and operate at high speeds for short times.
- Designed with **high deflection**.
- Among the strongest and toughest pneumatic tires.
- Must withstand high speed, heavy static and dynamic loads (e.g., main gear tires on a four-engine aircraft withstand speeds up to 250 mph and dynamic loads up to 33 tons).
- Tire parts include Tread, Breakers, Casing piles, Beads, Sidewall, etc..
- **Tread**: Wearable part in contact with the ground. Resists frictional wear, cracking, cuts, abrasion. Surface patterns:
    - **Rib tread**: Assists cooling, allows water away.
    - **Cross tread**: Smaller total contact area, provides less traction.
    - **Smooth tire** (mainly older aircraft): Greatest traction and largest contact area.
- **Creep marking**: A single white line across the tire and wheel rim to detect tire creep/slip (movement relative to the rim during heavy braking in hard landing), which can cause tube valve blow-out. Mismatch of the line indicates slip.
- **Classification**: Based on dimensions (diameter, rim), strength (ply-rating), and configuration (tubed/tubeless).
- Must be fitted according to the aircraft's operation manual.
- Types based on dimension (US Tire and Rim Association convention):
    - Types I, III, VII, VIII still in production. Types I, III, VII, and VIII are Three-Part Nomenclature tires.
    - **Type III**: Low-pressure tires for light aircraft. Two-number system (width in inches - rim diameter in inches).
    - **Type VII**: High-performance tires for jet aircraft. Two-number system (nominal overall diameter - section width).
    - **Type VIII**: High-pressure, high-speed for large jet aircraft. Three-number system (outside diameter - nominal tire width - rim diameter).
### Antiskid system
- **Normal skid control**: Performed during slowdown (not stopping). Removes some hydraulic pressure to the wheel when sliding begins to allow the wheel to rotate faster and stop the slide. Detection and control are independent for each wheel.
- **Locked wheel skid control**: Releases pressure when wheels are locked. Operates if normal skid control fails to prevent full skid.
- **Touchdown protection**: Prevents brakes from being applied during landing even if pedals are depressed. Prevents wheels from locking on the runway. Requires two conditions: squat switch signals weight on wheels, and wheel generator senses wheel speed over 15-20 mph.
- **Fail-safe protection**: Monitors the system and automatically returns brake system to full manual control if it fails, with a warning light.
