## **Aviation System Overview**  
- **Definition of Aviation**:  
  - Aviation includes all activities related to atmospheric flight, including aircraft operation, design, and production.  
  - **Key Sectors**:  
    1. Aerospace manufacturing (civil, military, and space).  
    2. Airlines (major, national, regional, cargo).  
    3. General aviation (private, non-scheduled).  
    4. Government aviation (military and non-military).  
    5. Airports and infrastructure.

## **Transportation and Air Transport**  
- **Role of Transportation**:  
  - Facilitates trade and global connectivity.  
  - Air transport is the fastest mode of connecting people, businesses, and delivering goods.  

- **Air Transport System Components**:  
  1. **Infrastructure**: Airports, networks, and flight routes.  
  2. **Vehicles**: Airlines and aircraft.  
  3. **Operations**: Air traffic control, flight crew, ground staff.  
  - Governed by national aviation authorities and international regulatory bodies.

## **Air Transport Categories**  
1. **Civil Aviation**:  
   - Non-military flying, including general aviation and scheduled air transport.  
   - **Scheduled Air Transport**: Regularly published routes for passengers and cargo.  
   - **Non-Scheduled Air Transport** (General Aviation): Private, recreation, air taxis, charters, ambulances, etc.

2. **Military Aviation**:  
   - Warfare-related air vehicles (fighters, bombers, transport, reconnaissance).  
   - Used for surveillance, combat, and other military objectives.

## **Aircraft Categories**  
1. **Civil Aircraft**:  
   - **General Aviation**: Includes business jets, gliders, trainers, firefighting, medical transport, etc.  
   - **Transport Aircraft**: Airliners, cargo planes, mail planes.  
   - **Special Purpose Aircraft**: Seaplanes, UAVs, rotorcraft.  

2. **Military Aircraft**:  
   - **Combat Aircraft**: Fighters, bombers, electronic warfare, multirole combat.  
   - **Non-Combat Aircraft**: Transport, reconnaissance, experimental.

## **Key Performance Indicators in Air Transport**  
1. **Passenger Kilometre (PKM)**:  
   - Measures passenger volume (Total Passengers × Distance).  
   - Example: A flight with 130 passengers over 4767 km generates 619,710 PKM.  

2. **Revenue Passenger Kilometre (RPK)**:  
   - Measures sales volume of paying passengers (Revenue Passengers × Distance).  

3. **Tonne Kilometre (TKM)**:  
   - Volume of freight carried (Freight in tonnes × Distance).  

4. **Available Seat Kilometre (ASK)**:  
   - Passenger capacity (Seats available × Distance).  

5. **Passenger Load Factor (PLF)**:  
   - Efficiency metric: **PLF = PKM / ASK**.  

6. **Yield**:  
   - Revenue per kilometre (Passenger Yield = Revenue / RPK; Cargo Yield = Revenue / TKM).

## **Economic and Social Benefits of Aviation**  
1. **Economic Impact**:  
   - Supported **87.7 million jobs** globally (pre-COVID).  
   - Contributed **$3.5 trillion** to global GDP (4.1%).  
   - In 2019:  
     - 4.5 billion passengers.  
     - 61 million tonnes of freight.  
     - $6.5 trillion in cargo value (35% of global trade by value).  

2. **Social Impact**:  
   - Facilitates tourism, trade, and cultural exchange.  
   - Provides essential services in remote areas (e.g. Royal Flying Doctor Service in Australia).  
   - Supports humanitarian efforts during natural disasters and emergencies.

## **COVID-19 Impact**  
- **Forecasts**:  
  - Central Scenario: 3% annual growth in revenue passenger kilometres over 20 years.  
  - Low-Growth Scenario: 2.7% annual growth due to health concerns, trade restrictions, and travel reluctance.
