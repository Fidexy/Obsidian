## Airports  

**Types of Airports:**  
1. **Commercial Service Airports**: Handle passenger and cargo traffic.  
2. **Cargo Service Airports**: Focus on scheduled freight transport.  
3. **General Aviation Airports:** Handle private or non-commercial flights.  
4. **Reliever Airports:** Reduce congestion at major hubs.  

**Towered Airports:**  
- Controlled by Air Traffic Control (ATC).  
- Pilots must maintain two-way communication.  

**Non-Towered Airports:**  
- No ATC tower present.  
- Pilots follow recommended procedures.  

**Runway Designator**
- Number part: magnetic heading rounded to the nearest 10
- Letter part (parallel runways only): L (left), R (right) or C (Center)
## Flight Number
- Not to be confused with the tail number of the aircraft
- Represents a scheduled flight route
- Made of a combination of the carrier's 2-letter IATA code and up to 4 letters
## Flight Rules
Detailed in ICAO Annex 2 Chapter 5

| Category                       | Ceiling     | Visibility  |
| :----------------------------- | :---------- | :---------- |
| Visual Flight Rules            | &gt;3000ft  | &gt;5 miles |
| Visual Flight Rules (marginal) | 1000-3000ft | 3-5 miles   |
| Instrument Flight Rules        | 500-1000ft  | 1-3 miles   |
| Low Instrument Flight Rules    | &lt;500ft   | &lt;1 mile  |
**Vertical separation minima**
- Minimum vertical distance required to safely separate aircraft flying at different altitudes
- Large separations to account for barometric errors at high altitudes
- Accurate altitude determination by satellite global positioning systems makes it possible to reduce the VSM for properly equipped airplanes
- R (reduced) VSM increases the number of aircraft that can fly in an airspace
- Aircraft must be **RVSM-certified** to operate in RVSM airspace.
- Certification ensures that the aircraft's altimeters, autopilot, and altitude-keeping systems meet the required precision standards.
## Air sovereignty
- Air sovereignty is the fundamental right of a sovereign state to regulate the use of its airspace, protect its territory and enforce its own aviation law - in extreme circumstance by the use of military fighter aircraft.
- Airspace above the land and sea areas of a state generally forms part of the sovereign state area
## Freedoms of the air
1. The right to fly over a foreign country without landing
2. The right to refuel or carry out maintenance in a foreign country without embarking or disembarking passengers or cargo
3. The right to fly from one's own country to another country
4. The right to fly from another country to one's own
5. The right to fly between two foreign countries on a flight originating or ending in one's own country
6. The right to fly from a foreign country to another while stopping in one's own country for non-technical reasons
7. The right to fly between two foreign countries, while not offering flights to one’s own country
8. The right to fly inside a foreign country, continuing to one's own country
9. The right to fly inside a foreign country without continuing to one's own country
## Route Systems
**Point to Point**
- Eliminate need for connections
- Reduce travel time
- Reduce risk of lost baggage
- Independent
- Worst best between major population centres
- Highly inefficient when flights are mostly half empty
**Hub and Spoke**
- A hub is a central airport that flights are routed through
- Spokes are the routes that planes take out of the hub airport
- Requires significantly fewer routes to connect all destinations when compared with the point-point system
- Small number of routes lead to more efficient use of transportation resources (more full flights)
- Complicated operations, such as package sorting and accounting, can be carried out at the hub, rather than at every node
- May cause congestion at large hubs
- Need for connections may cause delays or baggage lost
- Longer travel time


$$C=H(A-1)-\frac{1}{2}H(H-1)$$

Given that:

C = Number of connections

H = Number of hubs

A = Number of airports serviced


For a point to point system (H=A):

$$C=\frac{1}{2}A(A-1)$$

For a single hub and spoke system (H=1):

$$C=(A-1)$$

## Flexible use of airspace (FUA)
The principle that airspace should not be designated purely as civil or military
**Process to establish FUA**
- National civil/military coordination body
- National airspace planning process
- Agreement letters
- Process for publication
- Review and update process
- System that allows predictive and timely access to restricted airspace
**Airspace Management guidelines (ASM)**
- Available airspace should be managed in a flexible manner
- Airspace management process should incorporate dynamic flight paths
- Airspace use should be coordinated and monitored
- Reservation should be planned in advance
- System needs to accommodate unplanned requirements on short notice
- Must be aware that complex operations may limit flexibility
**Airspace design considerations**
- Restricted areas may not be designated over the high seas or airspace of undetermined soverignty
- Restricted areas should be designed to be as small as possible
- Should only be activated when required
**Collaborative decision making (CDM)**

## HKIA Third Runway
Runways were classified into 3 groups in terms of:
- Operational safety
- Obstacle clearance
- Airspace constraint issues
- ATC procedures
- Optimum mode of operations
Non-parallel new runway options were eliminated due to the following:
- Terrain constraints on Lantau Island South of the airport restrict the use of the non- parallel runway aircraft either departing to or arriving from the North
- Conflicts with air traffic procedures for the existing runways
- Clashes with traffic flying into and out of Macau and Shenzhen Airports
- The difficulty of landing safely on a non-parallel runway without imposing very restrictive operating dependencies on the existing runways
- Negligible gains in capacity offered by a non-parallel alignment.
### Option A (infeasible)
- Construct a near-perpendicular runway to existing runways
- Third runway can only be used for departures to the North
	Huge imbalance in departure and arrival capacity 
- The third runway in Runway 25 can be used in certain wind conditions only
### Option B (impractical)
- Construct a third runway aligned at an angle to the existing runways
- Conflict with air traffic procedures between the third runway and the existing runways in the Runway 25 direction
- Dependent operations create little or no additional capacity increase
- The lack of usability of the third runway in Runway 25 direction makes this option impractical
### Option C (most viable)
- Parallel alignment of the third runway with adequate separation
- Allows for fully independent parallel operations
- As per ICAO guidelines, a runway separation of at least 1,525m will allow independent parallel approaches in variable meteorological conditions
- Stagger of 1140m required to avoid an unacceptable climb gradient for missed approach and departure 
### Runway Separation
| Mode of operation        | Minimum Separation  | Maximum Capacity (hourly) |
| :----------------------- | :------------------ | :------------------------ |
| Arrivals only            | 3NM                 | 33                        |
| Departures only          | 90 seconds          | 35                        |
| Constrained Mixed Mode   | 8NM arrival spacing | 34                        |
| Unconstrained Mixed Mode | 6NM                 | 44                        |

## Sustainable Aviation
**Chemicals emitted:**
- Nitrogen Oxides (NOx)
- Carbon Monoxide (CO)
- Unburnt hydrocarbons (CH4 and VOCs)
- Sulphur Dioxide (SO2)
- Fine Particulate Matter (PM10 and PM2.5)
**Other negative impacts on the environment:**
- Water pollution
- Hazardous materials
- Noise pollution
- Migratory routes affected
### ICAO Environmental Protection Plan
**Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection (CAEP)**
- Assists the Council in formulating new policies and adopting new SARPs
- WG1- Noise
- WG2- Operations
- WG3- Emissions
- WG4 CORSIA
	- Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation
	- Work:
		- Maintenance of related SARPs
		- CO2 Estimating and Reporting Tool
		- Develop recommendations related to emission management
**Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF)**
- More expensive than fossil jet fuel, economies of scale might reduce costs
- Compatible with existing fleet
**Advanced technology and design**
- Engine technology focuses on reducing fuel burn, but higher efficiency can lead to increased NOx emissions
- Regulatory NOx and non-volatile Particulate Matter standards guide designs to address noise, air quality and climate change
- New nvPM standards aim to reduce particulate emissions
**Sustainable ATC**
- Dynamic airspace, route changing and advanced separation can retain efficiency while reducing fuel burn
### Contrails
**Formation**
1. Aircraft engines emit hot exhaust gases containing water vapor and particulates
2. The hot exhaust mixes with cold ambient air, causing rapid cooling and condensation
3. Water droplets freeze into ice crystals in the cooler upper wake region, forming visible contrails behind the aircraft
4. Depending on atmospheric conditions, contrails may persist and spread, evolving into contrail cirrus, or quickly dissipate
**Factors affecting contrail climate impact**
- Time of day (angle of incoming solar radiation)
- Cloud properties (optical thickness, surrounding atmosphere)
- Location (over land/sea)
- Duration
**Mitigation**
- Avoiding contrail formation through flight path adjustments
	- Tradeoff: higher fuel consumption, additional CO2 emissions
	- Short-term benefits of reduced contrail impact and long-term consequences of higher CO2 emissions have to be balanced
- Sustainable Aviation Fuels
	- Lower aromatic content could reduce soot and thus ice crystal formation
	- Higher cost compared to jet fuel
- Hydrogen-powered aircraft
	- Less water vapor emission
	- Additional benefit: no CO2 emission
	- Limits: Low energy density, high cost, new engines needed
### Impacts of high-speed ferries on CWDs
### Communication in aviation
**Confirmation bias**
The tendency to look for what confirms our beliefs and ignore what contradicts our beliefs
**Cockpit authority gradient**
Determined by assertiveness of pilots
- Authoritarian (Too steep)
	- Captain cannot take criticisms from colleagues
	- First Officer becomes too timid to voice opinions
- Laissez-Faire (Flat)
	- Most dangerous
	- Nobody/both pilots  making decisions
	- Cannot compromise/both laid back
- Synergistic (Ideal)
	- Determined Captain + Assertive First Officer
	- Respects each other’s opinions
	- First Officer grows by learning from Captain
	- Captain gets best solutions from First Officer
	- Captain can avoid mistakes given assertive corrections from First Officer
### Safety Culture
Represents attitudes of employees about an organization’s approach to safety and risk. Consists of 5 subcultures
**Flexible culture**
Flexible workers are given equal access to advancement, status, integration into business and assignment quality
