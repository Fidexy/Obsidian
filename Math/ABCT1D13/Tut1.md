## Q1
Cancer is a term for a disease which causes abnormal and uncontrolled growth of cells. Cancer cells can spread locally to adjacent tissue. Cancer cells can also spread sytemically by travelling to other organs via blood and lymph, causing secondary cancer
## Q2
Cancer is mainly caused by DNA damage. The damaged DNA cannot be repaired and then transferred to other cells during cell division. These daughter cells 

Increased cell division, or decreased apoptosis can cause cancer. When the rate of cell division is higher than that of cell death due to either reason, the number of living cells grows uncontrollably
## Q3
The cell cycle is regulated by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and cyclins. Too much CDKs and cyclins can cause cells to continuously enter the cell cycle and divide uncontrollably
Activaction of oncogenes such as RAS gene or MYC gene
Inactivation of tumor suppressor genes: P53, APC, BRCA 1 and BRCA 2
## Q4
Angiogenesis is when new blood vessels form from pre-existing vessels. Tumors induce angiogenesis in order to obtain more nutrients and oxygen for cancer growth, and to remove CO2. Cancer cells secrete agiogenic factors or ligands (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor; VEGF, and Basic Fibroblast Growth Factor; bFGF)
Endothelial cell secreted factors: MMP, uPA, uPAR and plasminogen activator break open the basement membrane of endothelial cells and increase permeability, aiding development of new blood vessels
## Q5
Some drugs block vascular endothelial growth factor from binding to the receptors on the endothelial cells, such as Avastin and Cetuximab
## Q6
Malignant cancer cells undergo metastasis.
They invade adjacent tissues, enter body circulation systems and spreads to establish secondary tumors in other parts of the body
