## **Key Performance Indicators in Air Transport**  
1. **Passenger Kilometre (PKM)**:  
   - Measures passenger volume (Total Passengers × Distance).  
   - Example: A flight with 130 passengers over 4767 km generates 619,710 PKM.  

2. **Revenue Passenger Kilometre (RPK)**:  
   - Measures sales volume of paying passengers (Revenue Passengers × Distance).  

3. **Tonne Kilometre (TKM)**:  
   - Volume of freight carried (Freight in tonnes × Distance).  

4. **Available Seat Kilometre (ASK)**:  
   - Passenger capacity (Seats available × Distance).  

5. **Passenger Load Factor (PLF)**:  
   - Efficiency metric: **PLF = PKM / ASK**.  

6. **Yield**:  
   - Revenue per kilometre (Passenger Yield = Revenue / RPK; Cargo Yield = Revenue / TKM).
