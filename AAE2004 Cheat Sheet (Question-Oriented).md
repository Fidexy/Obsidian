## Q2. Radar and ADS-B (8 marks)
[[Radar and ADS-B]]

| Feature                | Radar                                 | ADS-B                                |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Technology**         | Uses radio waves to detect aircraft.  | Uses GPS for precise tracking.       |
| **Data Provided**      | Position, altitude (SSR), speed.      | Position, altitude, velocity, ID.    |
| **Range**              | Limited by line-of-sight and terrain. | Global (with satellite ADS-B).       |
| **Accuracy**           | Moderate to high (SSR).               | High (GPS-based).                    |
| **Infrastructure**     | Expensive radar stations required.    | Ground stations or satellites.       |
| **Aircraft Equipment** | Transponder required for SSR.         | ADS-B Out/In avionics required.      |
| **Cost**               | High installation and maintenance.    | Lower infrastructure costs overall.  |
| **Coverage**           | Limited in remote or oceanic areas.   | Excellent in remote/oceanic regions. |

## Q3. Unit of transportation (6 marks)
1. **Passenger Kilometre (PKM)**:  
   - Measures passenger volume (Total Passengers × Distance).  
   - Example: A flight with 130 passengers over 4767 km generates 619,710 PKM.  
2. **Revenue Passenger Kilometre (RPK)**:  
   - Measures sales volume of paying passengers (Revenue Passengers × Distance).  
3. **Tonne Kilometre (TKM)**:  
   - Volume of freight carried (Freight in tonnes × Distance).  
4. **Available Seat Kilometre (ASK)**:  
   - Passenger capacity (Seats available × Distance).  
5. **Passenger Load Factor (PLF)**:  
   - Efficiency metric: **PLF = PKM / ASK**.  
6. **Yield**:  
   - Revenue per kilometre (Passenger Yield = Revenue / RPK; Cargo Yield = Revenue / TKM).
