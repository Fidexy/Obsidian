# Engine Types
- **Turbojet Engine**:
    - Fans (compressors) work on the air. 
    - Compressed air enters the combustion chamber. 
    - High-pressure, high-temperature air interacts with injected fuel, causing combustion. 
    - Hot expansion air passes through the exit nozzle, generating thrust. The air also helps turn the compressor shaft. 
    - Air flow is faster at the exit nozzle than the inlet.
- **Turbofan Engine**:
    - Principle similar to turbojet. 
    - An additional fan sucks air. 
    - Part of the air is compressed and burned (core flow). 
    - **Part of the air flows through the bypass duct**, generating thrust.
    - **Fuel efficiency increases with bypass ratio (BPR)**. 
	    - BPR is the ratio of mass flow rate of the bypass stream to the mass flow rate entering the core.
    - Many commercial engines have **high BPR**. This leads to **high fuel efficiency & low noise emission**.
    - Large BPR means higher mass flow rate, so less speed change is needed for the same thrust.
    - Bypass air has lower temperature, reducing the temperature of the mixed exhaust, increasing **thermal efficiency** and fuel efficiency.
    - Noise from the engine jet is significantly reduced.
- **Turboprop Engine**:
    - Uses a gas turbine core to turn the propeller.
    - Most exit gas drives the turbine connected to the propeller shaft.
    - The exit velocity is low.
- **Turboshaft Engine**:
    - A special type of jet engine used in helicopters.
    - Used to drive the shaft of propellers (rotors) which generate thrust.
    - Combustion gases drive turbines connected to the shaft and rotor.
- **Ramjet Engine**:
    - Works efficiently at supersonic speeds around Mach 3 and can operate up to Mach 6.
# Engine Components
- **Air Intake**
	- Delivers air to compressor
	- Inlet core streamlined to optimize airflow
- **Compressor**
	- Components:
		- Rotor blades
		- Rotor shaft
		- Stator vanes
		- Stator casing
		- Stator seal
	- Rotors increase air velocity
	- Stators moderate air flow direction
	- The compressor is driven by the turbine through a shaft.
	- A **spool** is a set of independent compressor-shaft-turbine assemblies. Engines can have multiple spools for each compressor to operate at different speed for efficiency.
	- **Centrifugal Compressor**: 
		- Used in early turbojets. 
		- Flow turns perpendicular to rotation axis (radial flow). 
		- Impeller spins flow outwards at high speed. 
		- Diffuser reduces flow speed, increasing pressure. 
		- Compressor manifold regulates air pressure. 
		- Compression ratio around 1:2.5 to 1:4.
    - **Axial Compressor**: 
	    - Airflow is parallel to the axis of rotation. 
	    - Made of casing with stators and rotor with blades. 
	    - Every rotor followed by a stator forms a stage. 
	    - Continuously pressurises gases. 
	    - Each stage incrementally boosts pressure (ratio ~1.2-1.6). 
	    - Benefits: **High efficiency and large mass flow rate**. 
	    - Requires several stages for large pressure rise (e.g., factor of 30) making them complex and expensive.
    
- **Combustion Chamber**
	- Completes combustion, contains flame, exhausts hot gases, prevents backfire. 
	- Contains outer casing, outer liner, diffuser, inner casing, inner liner. 
	- Shape affects flow instability, turbulence, flame instability. 
	- Incomplete combustion can cause fuel particles to strike turbine blades
- **Turbine**
	- Converts heat/kinetic energy into **mechanical work** via gas expansion. 
	- Mechanical work drives compressors and other devices. 
	- Components: 
		- Nozzle guide vane (increases velocity, reduces pressure/temperature)
		- Blades (allow gas expansion, stabilise flow)
		- Shroud (protects casing, prevents leakage).
- **Exhaust System**
	- Nozzle located at engine end. 
	- Accelerates hot gases to increase thrust, clears exhaust gases to prevent back pressure. 
	- Contains:
		- Propelling nozzle
		- Exhaust nozzle (flow acceleration)
		- Exhaust core (flow guiding). 
		- Nozzle duct can be non-mixing or mixer type. 
		- Exhauster mixer reduces jet noise by reducing core air velocity.
# Engine starting
1. Open low pressure valves.
2. Rotate the engine via APU.
3. Supply ignition energy.
4. Set throttle levers to idle to open high pressure valves.
5. Switch off ignition when self-sustaining.
6. Switch off rotation power source.
