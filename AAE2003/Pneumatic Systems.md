- Usage of bleed air:
	- Provision of motive power:
		- High pressure: Drive valves
		- Low pressure: start engines
	- Acts as heating source (anti-icing)
	- Pressurize cabin
	- Air conditioning
	- Pitot-static system
	- Environment control
# Pneumatic system components
- **Compressor**
- **Air filter**
	- Prevents system contamination
	- Removes air particulates
- **Pressure regulator**
	- Prevents system from being overpressurized
	- Insures proper calibration
- **Actuators**
	- Can provide linear or rotary motion
	- Controlled by solenoids
- **Piping**
	- To guide compressed air flow
- **Valves**
	- Controls air flow rate and direction
	- Knob-operated or solenoid-based (24VDC)
# Pneumatic system VS hydraulic system
|                        | Hydraulic system        | Pneumatic system       |
| :--------------------- | :---------------------- | :--------------------- |
| **Fluid**              | Incompressible liquid   | Compressed gas         |
| **Pressure**           | Up to 700 bar           | ~5-10 bar              |
| **Circuit**            | Closed                  | Open                   |
| **In case of leakage** | Performance reduced     | Little impact          |
| **Valve control**      | Difficult               | Easy                   |
| **Pressurization**     | From pumps              | From compressors       |
| **Safety**             | Unsafe for fire hazards | Free from fire hazards |
| **Lubrication**        | Necessary               | Not always needed      |

# Pneumatic system applications
- **Pneumatic tires**
	- Filled with air, tires act as shock absorbers to ensure landing gear integrity
- **Pneumatic oleo strut**
	- Lighter aircraft often use pneumatic oleo struts with nitrogen gas
	- A recharge valve system allows for easier maintenance
- **Pneumatic-driven flaps**
- **Air braking system**
- **Cargo door operation**
# Pneumatic air sources
**Engine**
	1. Air is taken from the engine (bleed air)
	2. High pressure control sensors regulate and control bleed air supply and pressure
	3. Air enters the pre-cooler
	4. A pressure shut-off valve controls the pressure and temperature of bleed air into the aircraft
	5. Bleed air is directed to the cowling for anti-icing
	6. Bleed air is distributed within other systems of the aircraft (e.g. cabin pressurization, ECU)
	- High-pressure Shut-off Valve (HPSoV)
		- Regulates pressure of air from the engines to 100 psi
		- Controls bleed air supply
	- Pressure-reducing Shut-off valve (PrSov)
		- Regulates air supply around cooler to 40 psi
		- Air temperature regulated by fan valves
		- Pressure and temperature sensors needed
