# Components
- **Hydraulic fluid**
	- Medium used to transmit power
	- Mineral-based fluids:
		- Cheap
		- Viscosity insensitive to temperature
		- Flammable, working temperature below 130c
	- Synthetic fluids
		- Less flammable
	- Working pressure affects system performance
	- Typical range ~3000 psi
	- High temperatures can reduce viscosity and cause oil degradation
	- Accumulator used to enhance flow rate
- **Hydraulic reservoir**
	- Supplies hydraulic fluid
	- Assists in separating contaminants with filters
	- Dissipates heat generated by the whole system
- **Hydraulic valves**
	- Pressure-relief valve limits pressure by diverting flow back to reservoirs
	- Flow control valve controls flow rate/speed. Can be pressure-compensated or non-pressure-compensated
- **Hydraulic pipelines**
- **Hydraulic pumps**
	- Needed to form a circuit
	- Takes fluid from the reservoir and pressurise it after passing through the pump
	- Flow motion itself doesn't generate pressure; resistance to flow by valves/discharge ports increases pressure
- **Hydraulic filters**
	- Removes particles in the hydraulic system
	- **Air breather**
		- Maintains pressure on hydraulic fluid
		- Connects with hydraulic reservoir to maintain pressure on hydraulic fluid
	- **Suction strainer**
		- Removes large particles while fluid resistance is low
		- Used at pump inlets
	- **Pressure line filter**
		- Located downstream from the pump
		- Removes small sized particles
	- **Return line filter**
		- Located at the control valve and fluid reservoir
		- Prevents debris from entering the reservoir via the return line
# Power Distribution
- Many components need hydraulic control, requiring various pressure levels and pumping sources
- Systems are often classified, e.g., Green system, Yellow system, Blue system
- Each system has its own reservoir, and the fluid from different systems cannot be connected
- Systems vary significantly between aircraft types (naming, pumping sources, controlled parts)
