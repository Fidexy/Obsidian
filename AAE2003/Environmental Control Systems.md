# Air conditioning
Air conditioning alone is sufficient for environmental control below 10,000 ft
Pressurization is needed above that altitude
### Humidity control
- For passenger comfort
- Prevents damage to electrical equipment
- Reduces the need for windscreen de-misting
- Water is removed through water separators
### Ventilation
- Maintains safe oxygen level by introducing fresh air, prevents hypoxia
- Removes CO2 buildup
- Reduces contaminants
- Controls temperature and heat load
- Prevents fogging and condensation
- Mitigates smoke and hazardous gases
- Reduces spread of airborne pathogens
- Closed system: 
	- Cabin and bay air is refrigerated and recycled
	- More equipment needed for recirculation
	- Higher thrust performance
	- Heavier and more expensive systems
- Open system:
	- Engine bleed air is refrigerated for use
### Cooling and heating
- Cooling involves transferring heat to heat sinks
	- Heat sinks can be ambient cold air or internal fuel
	- Refrigeration may be needed depending on heat sink temperature
- Heating is supplied by engine exhaust gas or turbine compressors
- **Ram air cooling**
	- Ram air temperature increases with flight speed (kinetic heating)
	- Decreased heat capacity and higher altitude (lower air density)
	- Fans can enhance flow
- **Fuel cooling**
	- Higher heat capacity than air
	- Limited application due to varying fuel amount
	- Mainly used to cool engine oil, hydraulic oil and gearbox oil
- **Refrigeration**
	- **Vapour cycle refrigeration**
		- Heat is absorbed by liquid coolant evaporation
		- CFC refrigerants are subject to debate as they damage the ozone layer
	- **Air cycle refrigeration** (Cold Air Unit)
		- Heat is removed from compressed air by a heat exchanger
		- Air expands through the turbine, reducing temperature as internal energy transfers to mechanical energy
		- **Turbofan system:** 
			- Typically used in low-speed civil aircraft where temperature is not very high. 
			- Employs a turbofan to compress coolant air
        - **Bootstrap system:** 
	        - Consists of a CAU (turbine driving compressor on a shaft) and two heat exchangers. 
	        - Used for high ram temperature conditions, e.g., high-performance fighters. 
			- Bleed air is cooled by ram air before being compressed and cooled a second time
			- Can self start
        - **Reversed bootstrap system:** 
	        - Changes the sequence of compressor/turbine passages compared to the bootstrap system. 
- Charge air
	- Generated by engine bleed air
	- Passes through:
		- **Flow control valve**: controls flow amount from engine bleed
		- **Bypass valve**: controls air into heat exchanger
		- **Primary heat exchanger**: cools with ram air
- Components
	- **Pack valve (supply shutoff valve):** 
		- Regulates bleed air going into the ACM. 
		- Modulates supply of hot, pressurized air, controlled from the cockpit.
	- **Primary heat exchanger:** 
		- Warm air crossing the ACM passes through it, and controlled ram air reduces its temperature. 
		- Ram air is modulated for the target heat change rate.
	- **Water separator:** 
		- Used to remove water from saturated cool air from the ACM before it enters the cabin. 
		- Foggy air enters, is forced through a fiberglass sock where mist condenses into larger drops, then swirled to collect water on the sides for drainage, letting dry air pass through.
- Inefficiency of current systems
	- Current systems use hot bleed air for cabin cooling, rejecting thermal energy into the atmosphere
	- Engine power is reduced due to ram air exchanger drag and bleed air consumption
	- Increased avionics systems add heat, increasing aircraft weight due to larger ECS.
	- Closed-loop systems can potentially increase reliability and efficiency.
	- **Liquid cooled systems:** 
		- Often used to remove heat from avionics systems and devices. 
		- Replaces air as the heat transport medium through a heat exchanger. 
		- Advantages: efficient, compact. 
		- Disadvantages: expensive, cooling medium is often toxic.
# Pressurization
- Pressurization controlled based on aircraft altitude
- Fulfills physiological needs of passengers and structural limitations
- Commercial aircraft is often pressurized to 8000 ft cabin altitude
- **Isobaric mode**
	- Maintains cabin altitude at a single pressure range
- **Constant differential mode**
	- Controls cabin pressure to maintain a constant pressure difference between cabin and ambient air
- Cabin design
	- The cabin must be designed as a pressure vessel with minimal leakage.
		-  Non-return valves are installed in air distribution pipes across the cabin wall.
		- Safety valves are installed in the cabin wall to relieve internal pressure.
	- Differential pressure is maintained high enough during flight to allow sufficient time for pilots to descend if pressurization fails.
- Unplanned decompression
	- Causes include airframe integrity loss, leaks or equipment malfunctions
	- Any failure above 10,000 ft requires an emergency descent to 8,000 ft and deployment of oxygen masks.
	- Without emergency oxygen, hypoxia can lead to loss of consciousness and loss of aircraft control.
	- Oxygen amount must be sufficient during descent to 8,000 ft.
	- An alternative is to increase cabin oxygen concentration.
# Anti-G System
- Used to counter blacking out due to lack of oxygenated blood supply to the brain
- Flight suits compress extremities using inflatable air bladders to reduce blood flow away from the brain
# Anti-icing/De-icing
- Causes of icing
	- Freezing of precipitation on aircraft surfaces
	- Supercooled liquid droplets impacting the aircraft structure
- Anti-icing systems (preventive):
	- Introduces hot bleed air to the icing location
	- Electrical heating
	- Deposits freezing point depressant onto the icing surface
- De-icing systems (remedial):
	- Pneumatic boots (a layer that inflates to break ice on surfaces)
	- Electrical heating
	- Uses magnet-induced mechanical motion to knock ice of surfaces
# Rain dispersal
- Windscreen wipers
	- Can scratch window surfaces
	- Increases drag
- Hot air jets
# Anti-misting and de-misting
- **Misting:** 
	- Occurs when transparency surface temperature falls below the dew point of surrounding air. 
	- Typically happens when descending from cold, dry high altitude into warmer, more humid air before surfaces warm up.
- **Anti-misting system:** 
	- Keeps transparency surface temperature above the dew point to prevent misting. 
	- Uses nozzles blowing ~100 Â°C air over the canopy from its base, or an electrically heated gold or metal oxide film on/between laminations.
- **De-misting system:** 
	- Clears mist if it occurs suddenly or the anti-mist system fails. 
	- Important on landing.
	- Consists of nozzles blowing high flow rate ECS air across the window.
