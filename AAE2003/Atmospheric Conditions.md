# Layers
1. **Troposphere**
    - Closest to Earth's surface
    - Weather occurs here
    - Extends up to about 8-15 km (5-9 miles)
    - Temperature decreases with altitude
2. **Stratosphere**
    - Above the troposphere
    - Contains the ozone layer
    - Extends from about 15 km to 50 km (9 to 31 miles)
    - Temperature increases with altitude
    - Operational limit of air-breathing engines
3. **Mesosphere**
    - Above the stratosphere
    - Extends from about 50 km to 85 km (31 to 53 miles)
    - Temperature decreases with altitude
    - Meteors burn up in this layer
4. **Thermosphere**
    - Above the mesosphere
    - Extends from about 85 km to 600 km (53 to 373 miles)
    - Temperature increases significantly
    - Contains the ionosphere, important for radio communication
5. **Exosphere**
    - Outermost layer
    - Extends from about 600 km to 10,000 km (373 to 6,200 miles)
    - Very thin atmosphere
    - Satellites orbit here
# Altitude Definitions
- **Absolute Altitude (ha)**
    - Height above sea level
    - Measured from the Earth's surface
- **Geometric Altitude (hG)**
    - Vertical distance from a reference point (e.g., Earth's surface)
    - Often used in aviation
- **Geopotential Altitude (h)**
    - Measures the potential energy of an object at a height
    - Takes into account gravitational variations
- **Relationship Between Them**
    - Absolute altitude can differ from geometric due to terrain
    - Geopotential altitude relates to the potential energy considering gravity changes with altitude.
# Atmospheric Wind
- Caused by forces acting on the air:
	- **Centrifugal force** due to the inertia of wind along curved path
	- **Coriolis force** related to the rotation of the Earth
	- **Turbulent drag** resistance to airflow of surface objects
- For wind towards a low-pressure region:
	- Directional convergence
	- Lifting of air
	- Bad weather
- For wind leaving a high-pressure region:
	- Directional divergence
	- Sinking of air
	- Good weather
# Atmospheric Turbulence
- Irregular motion of air from eddies and vertical currents
- **Mechanical turbulence**
	- Caused by friction from flows passing through irregular obstacles
	- Often gusty
- **Thermal turbulence**
	- Caused by uneven heat transfer due to differing heat capacities of surface conditions
	- Affected by the shielding of clouds
- **Frontal turbulence**
	- Caused by the lifting of warm air upon encountering a cold front
- **Wind shear**
	- A change in wind direction/speed over a horizontal/vertical distance
